Jewels and Stones<br />

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.<br />

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".<br />

Example 1:<br />
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"<br />
Output: 3<br />

Example 2:<br />
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"<br />
Output: 0<br />

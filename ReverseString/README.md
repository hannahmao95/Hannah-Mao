Reverse String<br />

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].<br />

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.<br />

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.<br />

 

Example 1:<br />

Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]<br />
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]<br />

Example 2:<br />

Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]<br />
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]<br />

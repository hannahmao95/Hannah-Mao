Two Sum<br />

Share<br />
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.<br />

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.<br />

Example:<br />

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,<br />

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,<br />
return [0, 1].<br />
